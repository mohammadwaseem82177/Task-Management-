# Task-Management 
Developed an interactive task management dashboard using Microsoft Excel to track task status, deadlines, owners, and team performance. Gained practical experience with Excel tables, conditional formatting, data validation, and charts to analyze progress and overdue tasks. Improved skills in data organization, reporting, and dashboard design.

## Project Objective
- To Design  and develop a dynamic and interactive task management tracker using microsoft excel
- To track and monitor task status such as completed, in progress, not started, and overdue in real time.
- To create an Excel dashboard displaying key performance indicators (KPIs) including task completion, pending tasks, and overdue tasks.
- To analyze task distribution by task owner, team, and employees for better workload management.
- To use Excel formulas (COUNTIF, SUM, TODAY, etc.) to ensure automatic updates and dynamic data flow.
- To apply conditional formatting to visually highlight task status and overdue tasks.
- To implement Excel features like tables, drop-down lists, charts, shapes, and text boxes for improved usability and interactivity.
- To enhance project tracking efficiency and support data-driven decision-making using Excel-based tools.

## Excel Data Set

## Question (KPIs) 
- How many tasks are completed, in progress, and not started as of today?
- What percentage of total tasks are overdue compared to the overall task count?
- Which team or task owner has the highest number of pending or overdue tasks?
- What is the average task completion time compared to the planned duration?
- How efficiently are tasks being completed based on the completion rate vs planned schedule?
